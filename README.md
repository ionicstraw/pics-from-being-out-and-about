# pics-from-being-out-and-about

i dont use any face filter or anything on my pictures, they're screenshots from the photos app on ios (so i have the original in case anyone lies and says i do use filters, i do not. never have, dont need to), i dont use facetune or anything, never have, never even installed the app.
